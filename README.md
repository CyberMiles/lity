[Lity] is an open-source language enhanced from [Solidity]. With new grammar extension, it is highly optimized for enterprise and easy to use for financial industry developers. The flexible interface and unlimited built-in functions can reduce gas cost and accelerate executing time. You can now encrypt large-sized data in the blink of an eye without running out of gas anymore.
