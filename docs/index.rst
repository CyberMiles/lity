Lity
====

This documentation for `Lity <https://github.com/CyberMiles/lity>`_
is still work-in-progress.

Overview
--------

Lity is an open-source language enhanced from Solidity. With new grammar extension, it is highly optimized for enterprise and easy to use for financial industry developers. The flexible interface and unlimited built-in functions can reduce gas cost and execution time. For example, you can now encrypt large-sized data in the blink of an eye without running out of gas anymore.

Since we still supports all features of Solidity, our documentation will focus on unique features realized by Lity.
