How to Contribute
=================

Help is always appreciated!

This document briefly explains the process to report an issue or submit
a pull request.

See the contribution guidelines in
`the Solidity documentation <https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html>`_
for more information.

Report an Issue
---------------

Please provide the following information as much as possible.

* The version (commit-ish) your using.
* Your platform, environment setup, etc.
* Steps to reproduce the issue.
* Your expected result of the issue.
* Current result of the issue.

Create a Pull Request
---------------------

* Fork from the `lity` branch.
* Avoid to create merge commits when you update from `lity` by using
  ``git rebase`` or ``git pull --rebase`` (instead of ``git merge``).
* Add test cases for your pull request if you're proposing new features or
  major bug fixes.
* Build and test locally before submit your pull request.
* Respect the `coding style <https://github.com/CyberMiles/lity/blob/lity/CODING_STYLE.md>`_
  for this project.
